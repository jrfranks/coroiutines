 * @brief Coroutine Example using Duff's Device and Macros
 *
 * C coroutines are an analogy to generators. Both C coroutines generators are
 * used to generate a sequence of results while maintaining their internal state
 * between calls. They are helpful for producing a series of values, particularly
 * in situations where it would be inefficient or unnecessary to generate all the
 * values at once.
 *
 * The C coroutines demonstrated in this example are implemented using macros,
 * which involve defining the coroutine structure and using switch statements to
 * resume execution at the last point where it was suspended The internal state
 * of the coroutine is manually managed, including setting the starting point,
 * the resume point, and updating the internal variables.
 *
 * Although the C coroutine approach shown here is more challenging to work with
 * compared to Python generators, it can offer more fine-grained control in
 * certain situations.
 *
 * This file demonstrates the implementation of coroutines in C using
 * Duff's Device and a set of macros, including COROUTINE_INIT, COROUTINE_BEGIN,
 * COROUTINE_YIELD, and COROUTINE_END. The concepts embodied in this code include:
 *
 * 1. Coroutines: A programming concept that generalizes subroutines for
 *    non-preemptive multitasking by allowing multiple entry points for
 *    suspending and resuming execution at certain locations.
 *
 * 2. Duff's Device: A technique that allows multiple iterations of a loop to
 *    be unrolled and executed in parallel, which can potentially improve
 *    performance.
 *
 * 3. Macros: The C preprocessor provides a mechanism for defining macros,
 *    which are textual substitutions that occur during preprocessing, before
 *    the actual compilation of the code. In this case, macros are used to
 *    implement the coroutine functionality.
 *
 * The example provided is a simple coroutine that calculates and yields doubled
 * values of numbers from 0 to 9. The main function repeatedly calls the
 * coroutine and prints the yielded values until the coroutine is done.
