# Coroutine Example using Duff's Device and Macros
This project demonstrates the implementation of coroutines in C using Duff's Device and a set of macros. Coroutines are a programming concept that generalizes subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking by allowing multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at certain locations.

The example provided is a simple coroutine that calculates and yields doubled values of numbers from 0 to 9. The main function repeatedly calls the coroutine and prints the yielded values until the coroutine is done.

## Concepts
### Coroutines
 A programming concept that generalizes subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking by allowing multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at certain locations.

### Duff's Device
 A technique that allows multiple iterations of a loop to be unrolled and executed in parallel, which can potentially improve performance.

### Macros
 The C preprocessor provides a mechanism for defining macros, which are textual substitutions that occur during preprocessing, before the actual compilation of the code. In this case, macros are used to implement the coroutine functionality.

## Macros used
 - COROUTINE_INIT:   Called by the initial caller to set up the mapper starting point.
 - COROUTINE_BEGIN:  Marks the beginning of the coroutine.
 - COROUTINE_YIELD:  Suspends the coroutine execution and saves the current position.
 - COROUTINE_END:    Marks the end of the coroutine.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Compile the coroutine_example.c file:

    make

Run the resulting executable:

    ./coroutine_example
    Output: 0
    Output: 2
    Output: 4
    Output: 6
    Output: 8
    Output: 10
    Output: 12
    Output: 14
    Output: 16
    Output: 18

This should print the doubled values of numbers from 0 to 9, as generated by the coroutine.
